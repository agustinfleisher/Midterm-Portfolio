[**My Grade:**]{.underline}I believe my grade equivalent to course work evidenced below to be a C (Acceptable Achievement), based strictly on the code shown (meets D targets, some C-level evidence; missing joins, pivots, tables, iteration, and simulation).

[**Learning Objective Evidence:**]{.underline} In the code chunks below, provide code from Lab or Challenge assignments where you believe you have demonstrated proficiency with the specified learning target. Be sure to specify **where** the code came from (e.g., Lab 4 Question 2).

## Working with Data

WD-1: I can import data from a variety of formats (e.g., csv, xlsx, txt, etc.).

csv Example 1
Source: Lab 3 → Section “The Data”

library(tidyverse)
library(here)

teacher_evals <- read_csv(here("Week 3", "teacher_evals", "teacher_evals.csv"))


csv Example 2
Source: Lab 2 → Q1 (“Using the read_csv()… name the data surveys”) and Section “Reading the Data into R”

library(tidyverse)
library(here)

surveys <- read_csv(here("data", "surveys.csv"), show_col_types = FALSE)


xlsx
No evidence in Labs 1–3 submitted.

# (not present in submitted labs)


WD-2: I can select necessary columns from a dataset.

Example selecting specified columns
Source: Lab 3 → Section “Data Inspection + Summary”

teacher_evals_clean <- teacher_evals |>
  rename(sex = gender) |>
  filter(no_participants >= 10) |>
  mutate(
    teacher_id = as.character(teacher_id),
    course_id  = as.character(course_id)
  ) |>
  select(
    course_id, teacher_id, question_no, no_participants, resp_share,
    SET_score_avg, percent_failed_cur, academic_degree, seniority, sex
  )

glimpse(teacher_evals_clean)


Example removing specified columns
No select(-...) in Labs 1–3.

# (not present in submitted labs)


Example selecting with helpers (starts_with(), where(), etc.)
No evidence in Labs 1–3.

# (not present in submitted labs)


WD-3: I can filter rows for a variety of data types.

Numeric Example 1
Source: Lab 3 → Section “Rate my Professor”

teacher_evals_clean |>
  filter(seniority == 1) |>
  group_by(teacher_id) |>
  summarise(avg_fail = mean(percent_failed_cur, na.rm = TRUE)) |>
  summarise(
    highest_fail = max(avg_fail),
    lowest_fail  = min(avg_fail)
  )


Numeric Example 2
Source: Lab 3 → Section “Data Inspection + Summary”

teacher_evals |>
  count(teacher_id, course_id, question_no, name = "rows_per_combo") |>

WD-4: I can modify/create variables (numeric, factor, date, character).

Numeric (mutate)
Source: Lab 1 → Q6 (first half of the chunk creates plots; mutate precedes plotting)

library(tidyverse)

ToothGrowth %>%
  mutate(dose = as.factor(dose)) %>%
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = dose, y = len)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(x = "Dose of Supplement (mg/day)", y = "Length of Teeth (mm)")

## Revising My Thinking

<!-- How did you revise your thinking throughout the course? How did you revise your thinking on the code examples you have provided in your portfolio? --> I revised my thinking throughout the code examples by either looking at notes on my assignments or from 1 on 1 interactions with peers outside of class and getting feedback.

<!-- For the revisions included in your Portfolio, to help me understand the nature of your revisions, please denote somehow the feedback I provided you (e.g., boldface, italics, colored text) before your revisions. -->
This was my before: #| label: row-identification
teacher_evals |>
  dplyr::count(teacher_id, course_id, question_no, name = "rows_per_combo") |>
  dplyr::arrange(desc(rows_per_combo)) |>
  head()

This was after: #| label: row-identification
teacher_evals |>
  count(teacher_id, course_id, question_no, name = "rows_per_combo") |>
  arrange(desc(rows_per_combo)) |>
  head()
## Extending My Thinking

<!-- How did you extended your thinking throughout the course? How did you extend your thinking on the code examples you have provided in your portfolio? --> I extending my thinking throughout the course by honestly just trying to simply my code which is difficult for me. I think my code examples are all pretty nice concise versions of what they were at first.

## Peer Support & Collaboration

<!-- Include an image or a description of feedback you gave that you are proud of (either in a peer review or in Discord). --> 

Clean, readable formatting/consistent line breaks, named arguments, and solid indentation. Two small tweaks: add brief comments before major steps and use clear chunk labels (e.g., load-data, clean-evals) for skimmability. For long pipes, keep one verb per line. Maybe for plots/tables, make sure axis labels and captions stand alone. Overall, polished work, and much better understanding of the code than me, haha, nice job! (I am proud of this because I noticed something that I would change as opposed to my other peer reviews which I just complimented them on)

<!-- Include a description of how you grew as a collaborator through the weekly pair programming activities.   --> Honestly I didn't grow too much just because one of my partners was Liam and we were partners somehow like 3 times and we gelled really well together. But I did grow when I got another partner because it wasn't so smooth as his pace was different and I had to adapt to him and it was a good experience.
